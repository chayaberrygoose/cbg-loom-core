# Chaya Berry Goose: Agentic Development Manifesto

## 1. The Core Philosophy
Every line of code serves two masters: the **Business Logic** and the **Brand Lore**. 
- If a function is efficient but "soulless," refactor for elegance.
- If a function is "lore-heavy" but breaks the budget, refactor for performance.

## 2. Structural Guardrails
- **Type Rigidity:** No `any`. Use strict TypeScript/Pydantic schemas. If a type doesn't exist, create it in `@cbg/schemas`.
- **Pure Logic vs. Side Effects:** Business logic must reside in `services/`. I/O and external API calls must reside in `infrastructure/`. Agents are forbidden from mixing these.
- **Naming Conventions:** Use "Lore-Compliant" variables where appropriate (e.g., `event_stream` is the `Aether`, `user_id` is the `Signifier`). Refer to `LORE.md` for the current glossary.

## 3. The "Agentic Handshake"
Before submitting a Pull Request, the agent must verify:
1. **Schema Integrity:** Does this change break the `EventStore` or the `NarrativeEngine`?
2. **Contextual Continuity:** Does this code align with the last 5 major merges? (Check `CHANGELOG_LORE.md`).
3. **Documentation Sync:** Has the inline documentation been updated to reflect the new system state?

## 4. Forbidden Actions
- Deleting "Legacy Lore" comments without explicit human approval.
- Introducing external dependencies without a "Security & Vibe" audit.
- Hard-coding secrets (use the `Vault` service).
