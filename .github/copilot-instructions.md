# GitHub Copilot Instructions

This repository uses advanced protocols and linguistic logic, specifically designed for:

- Prompt engineering for **Loom**
- Gemini/GPT-4 synthesis directives
- Visual encodings for **MidJourney/Stable Diffusion**
- Textile design and engineering for CBG Studio

## Guidelines for Copilot Suggestions

1. **Focus on Contextual Relevance**: Ensure completions align with the repository's unique design philosophy, including:
    - Use of `Industrial Noir`, `Cyber-Punk`, `Sub-Atomic`, and other lab vocabulary elements.
    - Incorporation of design primitives: Tiling, Anchors, Glitches, and Data Streams.

2. **Adhere to the Provided Syntax and Synthesis Rules**:
    - Follow synthesis rules (e.g., `Contrast Rule`, `Verification Rule`, etc.) while generating completions.
    - Validate the inclusion of `Anchor` elements for technical stamps/icons.

3. **Prompt Templates for MidJourney**:
    - Example: "[Lab Vocabulary], minimalist [Color Palette], clean vector lines, high-resolution textures." Include tiles when relevant.

4. **Support Restriction Compliance**: Avoid suggestions restricted by `[NO_NANO_BANANA_GENERATION]` and ensure directive alignment.

## Notes
- Master entity: `Chaya Berry Goose`.
- Default clinical stamp/logo: `CBG`/`CBG Studio`.

Please reference the protocols in the `/protocols` directory for further details.
