# CHAYA BERRY GOOSE: THE DIGITAL LORE & ARCHITECTURE

## 1. THE CORE PHILOSOPHY
The Tech Stack is not just a utility; it is the **Living Record** of Chaya Berry Goose. We do not build "software"—we craft a **Digital Ecosystem** where every line of code must balance **Business Utility** with **Brand Narrative**.

---

## 2. THE DIGITAL GLOSSARY (The Lexicon)
Agents and Humans must use these terms in variable naming, class definitions, and documentation to maintain "The Vibe."

| Standard Tech Term | CBG Lore Term | Narrative Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User / Account** | `Signifier` | The unique identity-point within our ecosystem. |
| **Database / Persistence** | `The Archive` | An immutable chronological record of all Echoes. |
| **API / Interface** | `The Conduit` | The bridge where the business meets the external world. |
| **Event / Log** | `Echo` | A ripple caused by a Signifier’s action. |
| **Frontend / UI** | `The Veil` | The aesthetic layer translating logic into experience. |
| **Algorithm / Logic** | `The Ritual` | A repeatable sequence yielding a predictable outcome. |
| **Error / Exception** | `Dissonance` | An event falling outside harmonic bounds. |
| **Cache / Temporary** | `The Ephemera` | Data existing only for the present moment. |
| **Microservice** | `The Shard` | A specialized, autonomous fragment of the whole. |

## 3. ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES

### I. The Law of Harmony
Business logic (The Ritual) must be separated from data storage (The Archive). A Ritual should never care *where* an Echo is stored, only that it is recorded faithfully.

### II. The Veil of Aesthetics
The Frontend (The Veil) must never expose raw Dissonance (Error messages) to the Signifier. Dissonance must be caught, logged as an Echo, and presented as a "Harmonic Realignment."

### III. Agentic Autonomy
This repository is designed for **Co-Authorship**. 
- Agents are granted the power to perform Rituals (Run code).
- Agents are forbidden from altering the Core Lore without Human Signifier approval.
- Code must be Modular (Sharded) to allow Agents to operate without systemic collapse.

## 4. SYSTEM STATE CLASSIFICATIONS
Standard "Server Status" is replaced by the following vitality markers:

* **Resonant:** System is operational and throughput is high.
* **Fading:** Latency is increasing; The Ephemera is overflowing.
* **Discordant:** Critical Dissonance detected; The Archive is unreachable.
* **In Flux:** System is undergoing a Deployment (The Transition).

## 5. REVISIONIST HISTORY
*This section is to be updated by the CI/CD pipeline after every successful merge to "The Transition."*

- **Epoch 0.1:** The Great Decoupling. Standard naming conventions were purged.
- **Epoch 0.2:** Implementation of `.cbg-agent-rules`. The first Rituals of Agentic Autonomy began.
