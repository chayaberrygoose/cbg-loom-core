[LOG_DATE: 2026-02-16] // PROTOCOL: SWATCH_ENGINEERING_V2.0

Objective

Establishment of core design primitives, vocabulary, and synthesis rules for C.B.G. Studio textile engineering. This protocol replaces previous versions and dictates prompt structure for external generation (Midjourney).

---

I. DESIGN PRIMITIVES

• TILING (THE FIELD): Seamless, repeating base fabrics (e.g., Obsidian ISO grids).

• ANCHOR (THE VALIDATOR): Localized technical stamps/icons to verify engineered status.

• GLITCH (THE DISRUPTOR): Asymmetrical artifacts (signal loss) to break grid flow.

• DATA STREAM (THE LINEAR): Directional elements for motion/framing (sleeves, spine).

II. THE LAB VOCABULARY

• INDUSTRIAL NOIR: Logic/Engineering. Obsidian, Grey, White.

• CYBER-PUNK: Rebellion/Chaos. Tartan, Red, Glitched Fishnets.

• SUB-ATOMIC: Truth/Analysis. Phosphor Green, TEM Lattices, Moire Fringes.

• SACRED AND PROFANE: History/Poetry. Vellum, Anatomical Sketches, Etched Poetry.

• VIBRANT MODERNIST: Movement/Energy. Bauhaus Geometry, Primary Shards.

III. SYNTHESIS RULES

1. THE CONTRAST RULE: Pair high-chaos (Plaid) with high-order (ISO Grid).

2. THE VERIFICATION RULE: Minimum of one Anchor per piece.

3. THE PHOSPHOR SHIFT: Phosphor Green is reserved exclusively for Sub-Atomic elements.

IV. MIDJOURNEY ARCHITECTURE

• Tiling: `... [Lab Keywords], minimalist [Color Palette], clean vector lines, high-resolution technical texture --tile --v 6.0`

• Anchor: `... minimalist [Lab Keywords], centered on a [Color] background, technical legend typography, blueprint schematic style --v 6.0`
