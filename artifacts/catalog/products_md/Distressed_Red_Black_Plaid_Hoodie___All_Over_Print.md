## Description
A bold, all-over printed pullover hoodie that wraps you in classic lumberjack energy with an urban edge. The red-and-black plaid is amplified with painterly brush strokes for a lived-in, textured look that stands out in a crowd. The roomy kangaroo pocket and adjustable hood make it an easy go-to for cool mornings, late-night walks, or layering over band tees. Built from durable polyester and custom cut-and-sewn for full-wrap graphics, this hoodie keeps color vivid and shape intact wash after wash. It feels rugged, comfortable, and a little rebellious — for anyone who likes heritage patterning with contemporary attitude.
