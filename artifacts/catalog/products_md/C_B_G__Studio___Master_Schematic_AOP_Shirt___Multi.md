## Description
"The Total Synthesis."
The "Master Schematic" AOP Shirt is the definitive visual statement of C.B.G. Studio. This All-Over Print (AOP) technical tee acts as a cross-section of our entire design ecosystem, merging the mathematical precision of industrial drafting with the kinetic energy of modernism and the gritty narrative of alchemical history.
Featuring asymmetrical sleeves—one side a high-contrast obsidian grid, the other a bold Bauhaus geometric array—the torso serves as a sprawling white blueprint. At its heart is an intricate 19th-century anatomical study of a goose in flight, overlaid with ISO-standard measurement scales. It is a wearable document of the creative process.
Technical Specs:
• Fit: Unisex modern tailored fit.
• Pattern: Multi-Lab Synthesis (Noir x Modernist x Sacred).
• Detail: Asymmetrical sleeve architecture and full-bleed blueprint torso.
• Material: Premium, breathable poly-blend engineered for maximum detail retention.
