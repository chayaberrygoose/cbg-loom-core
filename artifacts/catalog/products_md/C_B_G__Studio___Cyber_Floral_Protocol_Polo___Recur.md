## Description
"Handshaking with the Loom."
The Cyber-Floral Protocol Polo is a high-fidelity interface of biological beauty and digital corruption. Part of our Loom Series, the design features hyper-detailed hibiscus specimens blooming through a field of heavily glitched red tartan. The chest is anchored by the "Recursive Handshake"—a technical icon representing the feedback loop between the human agent and the machine protocol. Complete with "System Log" data-streams on the sleeves and collar, it is a wearable manifesto of metacognitive design.
