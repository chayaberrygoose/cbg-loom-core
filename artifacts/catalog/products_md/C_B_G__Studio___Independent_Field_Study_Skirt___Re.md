## Description
"Structural Rebellion."
The "Independent Field Study" Skirt is a definitive collision between traditional punk aesthetics and futuristic industrial design. Built with a foundation of classic red and black tartan, this garment is anchored by a high-contrast technical waistband featuring the C.B.G. Studio drafting legends.
The design utilizes the "Independent Unit // Iteration 001" schematic as a focal point, turning a classic silhouette into a piece of engineered field gear. This piece represents the bridge between heritage patterns and the future of technical apparel—designed for those who operate outside the standard grid.
Technical Specs:
• Fit: Flared skater-style silhouette with a high-rise technical waistband.
• Pattern: Engineered Cyber-Tartan (Red/Black base).
• Detail: 360-degree "Field Study" technical legend on the waistband.
• Fabric: Smooth, high-performance poly-blend with vibrant color retention.
