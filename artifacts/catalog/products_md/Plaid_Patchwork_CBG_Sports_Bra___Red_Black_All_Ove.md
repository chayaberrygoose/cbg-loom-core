## Description
Bold, vintage-inspired sports bra with an all-over red and black plaid background, distressed graphic panels and a subtle teal emblem. It compresses comfortably for movement and keeps you cool with moisture-wicking fabric. Wear it for morning lifts, urban runs, or layered under an open flannel when you head out to rehearsals, markets, or late-night drives. The racerback lets your shoulders move freely while the wide elastic band holds everything steady — built for rhythm, grit, and days that start early and finish loud.
