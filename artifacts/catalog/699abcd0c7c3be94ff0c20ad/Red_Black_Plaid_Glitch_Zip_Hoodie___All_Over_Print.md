## Description
A bold, all-over zip hoodie that walks the line between grunge and cabin-core. The red-and-black distorted plaid wraps every seam, giving a lived-in, layered look that feels like a favorite flannel reimagined in streetwear form. The roomy hood and front pockets make it easy to slide into on a chilly morning commute or after a day chopping wood at the lake. Subtle cuff and hem lettering and a contrasting black zipper add an urban edge while the medium-weight knit keeps the silhouette structured without feeling bulky. Wear it pulled up for quiet warmth or unzipped over a tee when the sun comes out — it blends city grit and rustic comfort in one wearable statement.
