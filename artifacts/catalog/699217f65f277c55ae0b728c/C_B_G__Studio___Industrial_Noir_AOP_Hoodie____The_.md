## Description
"Architecture for the Soul."
The first major drop from Chaya Berry Goose, LLC, the "Sacred Schematic" hoodie is a study in visual tension. This All-Over Print (AOP) masterpiece fuses the cold, mathematical precision of isometric drafting with the warm, organic grit of ancient alchemy.
Featuring a high-contrast obsidian torso etched with 45-degree isometric grids, the design is offset by "Sleeve Streams" inspired by historical anatomical sketches and weathered parchment textures. At the center sits the signature C.B.G. goose silhouette—an icon of grounded resilience set against a celestial sunburst.
Engineered for the modern outlier.
Technical Specs:
• Fit: Unisex, modern relaxed silhouette.
• Material: High-durability poly-blend (ensuring the "White-on-Obsidian" lines stay sharp forever).
• Construction: Cut-and-sewn by hand for seamless pattern alignment.
• Lab ID: 001-B (Industrial Noir x Sacred & Profane
