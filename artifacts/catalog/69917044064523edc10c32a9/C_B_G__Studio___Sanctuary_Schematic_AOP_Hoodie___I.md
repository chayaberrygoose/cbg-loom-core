## Description
"The Blueprint of a Myth."
A definitive proof of concept for C.B.G. Studio, the "Sanctuary Schematic" hoodie explores the intersection of architectural precision and ancient duality. This All-Over Print (AOP) garment bridges two worlds: the rigid, engineered geometry of a digital isometric grid and the weathered, organic textures of alchemical parchment.
The front features a repeating cathedral-inspired lattice, creating a structural gothic foundation. This is contrasted by the back's primary focal point—the signature Chaya Berry Goose silhouette, framed in a celestial sunburst and anchored by a classic drafting border. The sleeves serve as "Sleeve Streams," carrying the grit of historical anatomical sketches to balance the cold precision of the torso.
Designed for those who navigate the space between the technical and the transcendent.
