## Description
"Nature under Observation." This bomber jacket is the premiere piece of our Sub-Atomic Botanical collection. It features a hyper-detailed "Atomic Rose" back-anchor, rendered in phosphor green as a technical X-ray specimen. The shell is a custom "Technical Paisley" field, where traditional organic swirls are reimagined as microbial cultures and fluid dynamics. Finished with "Data Stream" measurement scales on the sleeves, it is a garment designed for high-fidelity analysis.
