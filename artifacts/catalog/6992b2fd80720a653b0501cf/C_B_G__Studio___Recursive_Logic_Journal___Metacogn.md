## Description
"Document the Simulation."
The Recursive Logic Journal is an essential interface for the independent unit. Part of the Loom Series, this hardcover archive features the Cyber-Floral field—a high-contrast intersection of hibiscus blooms and glitched red tartan. The cover is anchored by the "Analysis of Analysis" protocol and the signature "Cyborg Handshake," signifying the union of biological thought and digital execution. Use it to log system updates, protocol archaeology, or your own metacognitive shifts.
