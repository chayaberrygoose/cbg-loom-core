## Description
"The Blueprint of Independence."
The "Independent Field Study" Joggers represent a direct collision between traditional punk rebellion and futuristic industrial design. Built on a foundation of classic red and black tartan, these All-Over Print (AOP) pants are overlaid with the technical "blueprint" language of the C.B.G. Studio drafting labs.
Each leg is treated as a piece of field equipment, featuring the signature "Independent Unit // Iteration 001" data block. The design bridges the gap between heritage and the future—engineered for those who navigate the space between the technical and the transcendent.
Technical Specs:
• Fit: Unisex relaxed-fit joggers with tapered cuffs.
• Pattern: Engineered Cyber-Tartan (Red/Black base).
• Detail: "Field Study" technical legend on the upper thigh.
• Fabric: High-resolution poly-blend for sharp technical line retention.
